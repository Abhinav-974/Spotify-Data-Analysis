# Spotify-Data-Analysis
I use the Spotify Dataset to visualise data like the Top 7 Artists with Highest no. of charted positions. I have made a heatmap to visualise the correlations in the dataset.
I have made correlation plots like the variation of danceability of songs (between 0 and 1) with release year, the number of times a song has charted with the release year. I have made a bar graph to compare the popularity of the top 20 artists.
Lastly, I have visualised the top 30 most popular music genres with a pie chart by expanding the dataframe to have, for ech song, one row per genre, to seperate the songs based on genres.
